# RJMCMC
Reversible Jump MCMC Code for UiT MLG Summer Internship 2020

**Note: For my most recent work with RJMCMC on Bayesian Neural Networks, see my thesis repos at https://github.com/jberezow/BostonHousing and https://github.com/jberezow/OptDigits**

Current objective:

-Complete Gen tutorials as introduction to Julia / Gen PPL

-Implement example RJMCMC exercises


Future objectives:

-Implement simple BNN in Gen

-Use RJs to learn # of output classes (softmax) for a BNN classifier

-Use RJs to learn optimal latent space partition for a generative network (GAN)
